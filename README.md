# Business Lab & Professional Skills

Welcome to the Business Lab & Professional Skills GitHub repository. This repository contains the materials for Lecture 1 and the accompanying Tutorial 1 of the course.

## About the course:

This course integrates professional skill development with a strong foundation in Python programming and data analytics. Students learn to apply computational thinking to practical problems in accounting and business intelligence.

The Python component introduces core programming concepts and progresses to data-driven applications, including stochastic thinking, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means clustering, and Decision Trees. Students also explore natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition, to understand how textual data can inform decision-making and risk assessment.

Through hands-on exercises, students learn to extract, analyze, and interpret data using Python to identify risks and generate actionable insights. The course emphasizes how these analytical tools can be applied within the accounting profession to address contemporary challenges and support evidence-based decision-making.
